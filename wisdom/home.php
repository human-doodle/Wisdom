  <center><h3>WHY READ BOOKS ?</h3></center>

  <center><p><em>BOOKS ARE THE BEST FRIENDS</em></p></center>

  <center><p><em><q>Reading is to the mind what exercise is to the body.</q></em></p></center>

  <p>Joseph Addison penned this quote roughly 300 years ago, before modern science and research equipment could back up his claim. Today, however, scientific studies show that reading does make you smarter. Reading a novel, for example, increases the blood flow and improves connectivity in the brain. Reading introduces you to new ideas and invites you to solve problems.Have you ever solved a case in a mystery book before you read the conclusion or predicted a turn of events in a novel? Your analytical thinking was stimulated merely from reading. Reading helps you detect patterns, solve problems, and assimilate new information as if you were living in the charactersâ€™ shoes. Reading makes you a better writer
  When you read, your brain absorbs good writing techniques and vocabulary. In your own writing, you will unconsciously copy the writing styles of books that held your attention. Reading also enhances your vocabulary and spelling. New words appear in their natural context and you can deduce meaning from the surrounding words, while visually imprinting their spelling for accurate recall.</p>
