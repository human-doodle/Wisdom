# Wisdom
This project aims at developing a free, user-friendly economic website through which user can access each and every book of the website free of cost. After reading, users can also give their opinions regrading the genres of the catalogue by a poll system. 

The basis of this project is to create a web-based application for online library. The software and technique we used to create this application: Sublime, MySQL, Xampp Server, HTML, CSS, PHP, Ajax, JS and Chrome browser for testing purpose. 

Our overall approach is to create this website to help readers by providing a clean and beautiful UI. 

Following is the System flow:
